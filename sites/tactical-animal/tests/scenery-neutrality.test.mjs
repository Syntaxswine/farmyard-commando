// Seeded play on the other missions, hashed after every command. PR #21 recorded
// these runs from an unmodified origin/main checkout to show the Short Measure art
// changed nothing beyond its props; the guard approach search (docs/guard-approach.md)
// then changed play on every mission on purpose, so they were re-recorded from that
// change and now pin it. Seeds were picked where a guard fallback widened beyond
// props diverged within 44 commands. It samples play rather than proving anything:
// a global cover-radius change (0.9 -> 0.8 m) first shows at Night Ledger seed 8,
// command 188, so that run is 200 long.
